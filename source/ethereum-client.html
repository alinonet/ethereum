    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This configuration node holds a global connection to an ethereum client, that can be selected in other node
        configurations. During flow startup, it does an initial connection test to check if the ethereum client
        responds and throws an error if not.
    </p>
    <p>
        The node supports three connection protocols: HTTP, websocket (ws) and IPC. For HTTP and websocket also the
        secure versions are supported (https and wss). Which protocol to use depends on what the ethereum client
        supports and on the usage of the node palette. The <code>event-listener</code> node will only work, if a
        websocket connection is used, all other functionalities should work with HTTP and websocket. To chose a protocol
        nothing special needs to be done, it is decided by the provided <code>URL</code>. HTTP example:
        http://127.0.0.1:7545, websocket example: ws://127.0.0.1:7545, IPC example:
        /Users/myuser/Library/Ethereum/geth.ipc
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike HTTP, websocket establishes a permanent bidirectional connection to the ethereum client. If this
        connection gets interrupted it can affect the event subscriptions made by <code>event-listener</code> nodes,
        meaning events may not be received if they occur during a connection loss or the connection can be lost
        permanently. To deal with short network interruptions, the node will try to reconnect after a connection loss.
        If the reconnect is successful all event subscriptions are renewed. After the fifth unsuccessful reconnect
        attempt the connection is permanently lost.
